## Issue Categories

### 🔗 Data Access Issues
**Root Cause:** Google Drive credential propagation failures
- `Completed_boundingboxcoco.ipynb` - Data access method needs change
- `Completed.All Datasizes.Classifier.ipynb` - All Google Drive references need updating
- **Solution:** Implement Borealis API across all notebooks

### 🔧 Code Structure Issues
**Pattern:** Functions broken across multiple code blocks
- `Completed_Photoselect tool notebook.ipynb` - Functions segmented
- `Prompt Generator.ipynb` - Functions broken up
- `Completed.All Datasizes.Classifier.ipynb` - Duplicate functions, broken blocks
- **Solution:** Consolidate functions into single code blocks

### 📝 Documentation Issues
**Pattern:** Missing or unclear introductions
- All notebooks need pressbook links
- Several notebooks lack clear purpose statements
- `COMPLETED-ft-data-prep.ipynb` needs dataset comparison info
- **Solution:** Standardize introduction template

### ⚙️ Technical Issues
**Pattern:** CoLab compatibility and undefined variables
- `Completed_boundingboxcoco.ipynb` - 'image_path' variable undefined
- Several notebooks have untested CoLab compatibility
- **Solution:** Systematic CoLab testing protocol

## Detailed Notebook Issues

### High Priority Fixes

#### `Completed.All Datasizes.Classifier.ipynb` ❌
**Issues:**
- [ ] Unclear purpose/introduction
- [ ] Google Drive data access needs migration
- [ ] Appears to be merged from 2 notebooks (very long)
- [ ] `mount_google_drive()` function defined twice
- [ ] `safe_get_image_files()` function defined twice  
- [ ] `process_datasets` function defined but unused (typo for `process_dataset`?)
- [ ] Functions broken across code blocks
- [ ] Has pre-run cloud outputs (clarify these can't run in CoLab)

**Recommended Action:** Split into 2 focused notebooks

#### `COMPLETED-ResNet50-bounding-boxes.ipynb` 🔄
**Issues:**
- [ ] Contains 3 independent sections
- [ ] Should be split into 3 separate notebooks

**Recommended Action:** Create focused single-purpose notebooks

#### `Completed_boundingboxcoco.ipynb` ⚠️
**Issues:**
- [ ] Data access method needs change
- [ ] `image_path` variable not defined
- [ ] Removed reference to individual images (can restore from main branch if needed)

### Medium Priority Fixes

#### `Stable Diffusion.ipynb` ❌
**Issues:**
- [ ] Very large file size
- [ ] Consider splitting for better usability

#### `COMPLETED-ft-data-prep.ipynb` 🔄
**Issues:**
- [ ] Introduction needs dataset comparison (beyond COCO)
- [ ] Should explain dataset selection criteria

#### `COMPLETED-image-filter.ipynb` ✅
**Issues:**
- [ ] Somewhat repetitive sections
- [ ] Could add summary of changes needed per filter type

### Low Priority / Optional

#### `Completed_Photoselect tool notebook.ipynb` ⚠️
**Status:** Optional for final OER version
**Issues:**
- [ ] Functions broken into segments
- [ ] Very specific/ideosyncratic functionality
- [ ] Test in CoLab to determine if salvageable

#### `Blender.ipynb` ⚠️
**Status:** Move to pressbook as static content
**Issues:**
- [ ] Very large file
- [ ] Contains no executable code
- [ ] Documents AV's synthetic animal work

## Organization Recommendations

### Folder Structure
```
jupyter-notebooks/
├── 01-Dataset-Exploration/
├── 02-Object-Detection/  
├── 03-Classification/
├── 04-Visualization/
├── 05-Synthetic-Generation/
└── 99-Miscellaneous/
```

### Notebook Naming Convention
- Use consistent prefixes: `01-`, `02-`, etc.
- Include functionality in name
- Remove "COMPLETED" prefix after reorganization

---

## Testing Protocol

### CoLab Testing Checklist
- [ ] All code blocks run in sequence without errors
- [ ] Data sources accessible
- [ ] Outputs generate correctly
- [ ] Introduction/documentation accurate
- [ ] Links to pressbook functional

### Quality Standards
- Each notebook should have single, clear purpose
- All functions should be complete in single code blocks
- Introductions must explain purpose and usage
- Data access should work via Borealis API

## Completion Tracking

**Overall Progress:** 40% Complete

**Next Sprint Priorities:**
1. Fix data access infrastructure (Borealis API)
2. Split large notebooks (`Completed.All Datasizes.Classifier.ipynb`, `COMPLETED-ResNet50-bounding-boxes.ipynb`)
3. Test all notebooks in CoLab
4. Standardize introductions and documentation

**Estimated Total Effort:** 25-35 hours
