# mm-revisions

- This is file for keeping track of notes and revisions related to jupyter notebooks and code in the 'Understanding Animals' respository. These notes will be used to keep track of changes that need to be made - when you make a complete an edit please mark the checkbox to indicate that this change has been completed.

## general notes

- Are all of these jupyter notebooks referenced in the OER? This is something to check - we should have at least one link to each OER in the text. It could also be helpful to add a list of Notebooks as an appendix.
